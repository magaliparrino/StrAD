This project incorporates code from TSB-AD (Apache License 2.0), 
which in turn adapts code from various sources including:
- PyOD (yzhao062)
- Anomaly-Transformer (wuhaixu2016)
- TimeEval-algorithms (CodeLionX & wenig)
- FITS (VEWOXIC)
- OmniAnomaly (NetManAIOps)
- TimesNet (THUML @ Tsinghua University)
- TranAD (imperial-qore)
- USAD (manigalati)

All adapted models have been modified from the TSB-AD source to:
1. Standardize feature-wise normalization (replacing point-wise standardization).
2. Implement stateful normalization (parameters fitted on training data and reapplied during inference).
3. Remove pruning mechanisms (specifically in PCA and RobustPCA)
